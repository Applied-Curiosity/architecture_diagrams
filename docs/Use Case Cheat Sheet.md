### Identify and Document Key Use Cases Cheat Sheet

#### **Purpose**
Identifying and documenting key use cases help to define the primary functionalities and interactions of a system from the users' perspectives. Use case diagrams provide a visual representation of these interactions, making it easier to understand the system requirements and design.

#### **Structure of a Use Case Document**

1. **Title**
   - A clear, descriptive title for the use case document.

2. **Introduction**
   - Brief overview of the system and the purpose of documenting the use cases.
   - Description of the systemâ€™s scope and the users involved.

3. **Use Cases**
   - List and describe each key use case.
   - For each use case, include:
     - **Name**: The name of the use case.
     - **Actors**: The users or systems that interact with the use case.
     - **Description**: A detailed description of the use case.
     - **Preconditions**: Conditions that must be met before the use case can be initiated.
     - **Postconditions**: Conditions that must be met after the use case is completed.
     - **Main Flow**: The primary steps involved in the use case.
     - **Alternate Flows**: Any alternate paths or variations in the steps.

4. **Interactions**
   - Describe how the use cases interact with each other.
   - Highlight any dependencies or relationships between use cases.

5. **Visual Representation**
   - Create a use case diagram using Mermaid or another tool.
   - Include a legend to explain the symbols and colors used in the diagram.

6. **Review and Validation**
   - Describe the process for reviewing and validating the use cases.
   - Explain how stakeholders will be involved in the validation process.

7. **Conclusion**
   - Summarize the importance of the use cases for understanding the systemâ€™s functionalities and interactions.
   - Outline the next steps in the architectural design process.

8. **Appendices**
   - **Glossary**: Define any specific terms used in the document.
   - **References**: Provide links or references to related documents or sources.

**Title**: MonitorMe Key Use Cases

**Introduction**:
This document provides an overview of the key use cases for the MonitorMe system, illustrating the primary functionalities and interactions from the users' perspectives.

#### Use Cases

1. **Record Vital Signs**
   - **Actors**: Patient, Nurse
   - **Description**: Allows the recording of patient vital signs.
   - **Preconditions**: Patient is registered in the system.
   - **Postconditions**: Vital signs are recorded and stored in the system.
   - **Main Flow**:
     1. Nurse selects the patient.
     2. Nurse records the vital signs.
     3. System validates and stores the data.
   - **Alternate Flows**:
     - If validation fails, an error message is displayed.

2. **Analyze Data**
   - **Actors**: Data Analyst, System
   - **Description**: Analyzes recorded data to detect anomalies.
   - **Preconditions**: Data must be recorded in the system.
   - **Postconditions**: Analysis results are stored and alerts are generated if necessary.
   - **Main Flow**:
     1. System retrieves recorded data.
     2. System analyzes data for anomalies.
     3. System stores analysis results.
     4. System generates alerts if anomalies are detected.

3. **Send Alert**
   - **Actors**: System, Doctor
   - **Description**: Sends an alert to the doctor if an anomaly is detected.
   - **Preconditions**: Anomaly is detected in the data.
   - **Postconditions**: Doctor is notified of the anomaly.
   - **Main Flow**:
     1. System detects an anomaly.
     2. System generates an alert.
     3. System sends the alert to the doctor.
     4. Doctor acknowledges the alert.

#### Interactions

- **Record Vital Signs** interacts with **Analyze Data** by providing the data that needs to be analyzed.
- **Analyze Data** interacts with **Send Alert** by triggering the alert when an anomaly is detected.

#### Visual Representation

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "MonitorMe System"
    uc1((Record Vital Signs))
    uc2((Analyze Data))
    uc3((Send Alert))
    end

    patient[PatientðŸ‘¤]
    nurse[NurseðŸ‘¤]
    data_analyst[Data AnalystðŸ‘¤]
    doctor[DoctorðŸ‘¤]

    patient --> uc1
    nurse --> uc1
    uc1 --> uc2
    data_analyst --> uc2
    uc2 --> uc3
    doctor --> uc3
```

#### Review and Validation

- **Review Process**: The use cases will be reviewed in collaboration with domain experts and stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Stakeholders will provide feedback during review sessions to validate the use cases and their interactions.

#### Conclusion

The use case document provides a clear and structured approach to understanding the MonitorMe systemâ€™s functionalities and interactions from the users' perspectives. By documenting key use cases, we ensure that the system meets user needs and requirements.

#### Appendices

**Glossary**:
- **Use Case**: A description of a systemâ€™s behavior as it responds to a request from an external actor.
- **Actor**: A user, system, or entity that interacts with the system.
