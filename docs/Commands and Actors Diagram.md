### Commands and Actors Diagram

#### **Purpose**
The Commands and Actors Diagram visually represents the commands within the system, the actors who initiate these commands, and their interactions with domain events and aggregates. This diagram helps in understanding the roles of different actors, the actions they perform, and how these actions trigger various domain events.

#### **Structure**

### Commands and Actors Diagram

**Project/System Name**: MonitorMe  
**Date**: April 2024  
**Author(s)**: John Doe, Jane Smith

#### 1. Introduction

This document provides a visual representation of the key commands within the MonitorMe system, the actors who initiate these commands, and their interactions with domain events and aggregates.

#### 2. Commands

1. **Record Vital Signs**
   - **Description**: Command to capture the patient's vital signs.
   - **Trigger**: Scheduled intervals or manual initiation by medical staff.

2. **Analyze Data**
   - **Description**: Command to analyze the recorded data for anomalies.
   - **Trigger**: Completion of a vital signs recording.

3. **Send Alert**
   - **Description**: Command to send an alert to the medical staff.
   - **Trigger**: Detection of an anomaly.

#### 3. Actors

1. **Nurse**
   - **Description**: Medical professional responsible for patient care and monitoring.
   - **Role**: Initiates the recording of vital signs.

2. **Doctor**
   - **Description**: Medical professional responsible for diagnosing and treating patients.
   - **Role**: Reviews analyzed data and responds to alerts.

3. **Monitoring System**
   - **Description**: Automated system responsible for continuous monitoring and analysis.
   - **Role**: Automatically triggers data analysis and alert sending.

#### 4. Interactions

- **Nurse - Record Vital Signs**: The nurse initiates the **Record Vital Signs** command.
- **Monitoring System - Analyze Data**: The monitoring system triggers the **Analyze Data** command after recording vital signs.
- **Monitoring System - Send Alert**: The monitoring system triggers the **Send Alert** command upon detecting an anomaly.
- **Doctor - Respond to Alert**: The doctor responds to alerts generated by the monitoring system.

**Legend**:
- **Blue Sticky Notes**: Commands
- **Green Sticky Notes**: Actors
- **Orange Sticky Notes**: Domain Events

#### 6. Review and Validation

- **Review Process**: The commands and actors diagram will be reviewed in collaboration with domain experts and stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Stakeholders will provide feedback during review sessions to validate the interactions and triggers.

#### 7. Conclusion

The commands and actors diagram provides a clear visual representation of the roles and actions within the MonitorMe system. It helps in understanding how different actors interact with the system and trigger various commands and events, facilitating effective design and implementation.

#### 8. Appendices

**Glossary**:
- **Command**: An action that triggers one or more domain events.
- **Actor**: A user, system, or external entity that interacts with the system.
