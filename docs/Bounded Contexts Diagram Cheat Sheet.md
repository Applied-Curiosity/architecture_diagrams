### Bounded Contexts Diagram

#### **Purpose**
The Bounded Contexts Diagram visually represents the boundaries within which specific models and domains apply in the system. It helps in understanding the scope and limits of different contexts, ensuring that each part of the system is clearly defined and interactions between contexts are well-understood.

### Bounded Contexts Diagram

**Project/System Name**: MonitorMe  
**Date**: April 2024  
**Author(s)**: John Doe, Jane Smith

#### 1. Introduction

This document provides a visual representation of the bounded contexts within the MonitorMe system, illustrating the scope and interactions of different contexts to ensure clear definitions and understanding.

#### 2. Bounded Contexts

1. **Patient Monitoring Context**
   - **Description**: Responsible for monitoring patient vital signs and health metrics.
   - **Entities and Aggregates**: Patient, Vital Signs, Monitoring Session

2. **Alert Management Context**
   - **Description**: Manages alerts and notifications triggered by anomalies in patient data.
   - **Entities and Aggregates**: Alert, Notification, Anomaly

3. **User Management Context**
   - **Description**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and profile management.
   - **Entities and Aggregates**: User, Role, Profile

4. **Data Analysis Context**
   - **Description**: Performs analysis on patient data to detect anomalies and generate insights.
   - **Entities and Aggregates**: Analysis Session, Insight, Data Point

5. **Integration Context**
   - **Description**: Manages integration with external systems like Electronic Health Records (EHR).
   - **Entities and Aggregates**: EHR Interface, Data Import, Data Export

#### 3. Context Map

- **Context Relationships**:
  - **Patient Monitoring Context** interacts with **Alert Management Context** to trigger alerts based on monitored data.
  - **User Management Context** provides user authentication and authorization services to all other contexts.
  - **Data Analysis Context** receives data from **Patient Monitoring Context** and sends insights to **Alert Management Context**.
  - **Integration Context** imports and exports data to/from **Patient Monitoring Context** and **Data Analysis Context**.

- **Shared Kernels**:
  - **User Management Context** shares authentication and authorization components with all other contexts.

- **Upstream/Downstream Relationships**:
  - **Patient Monitoring Context** is upstream of **Alert Management Context**.
  - **Data Analysis Context** is downstream of **Patient Monitoring Context**.

#### 4. Visual Representation

**Legend**:
- **Rectangles**: Bounded Contexts
- **Arrows**: Interactions/Dependencies

#### 5. Integration Points

- **Interfaces**:
  - **REST API**: Used for communication between contexts.
  - **Message Bus**: For asynchronous data exchange.

- **Data Flow**:
  - **Patient Monitoring Context** sends data to **Data Analysis Context**.
  - **Data Analysis Context** sends insights to **Alert Management Context**.
  - **Integration Context** handles data import/export with external EHR systems.

#### 6. Review and Validation

- **Review Process**: The bounded contexts diagram will be reviewed in collaboration with domain experts and stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Stakeholders will provide feedback during review sessions to validate the context boundaries and interactions.

#### 7. Conclusion

The bounded contexts diagram provides a clear visual representation of the system's scope and interactions. By defining distinct contexts, we can ensure that each part of the system is well-understood and can evolve independently.

#### 8. Appendices

**Glossary**:
- **Bounded Context**: A defined boundary within which a particular model is valid.
- **Shared Kernel**: A component or set of components shared between multiple contexts.
