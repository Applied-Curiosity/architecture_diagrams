### Domain Events Diagram

#### **Purpose**
The Domain Events Diagram visually represents the key events that occur within a domain. It helps in understanding the flow of events, the relationships between different events, and their triggers. This diagram is a crucial artifact in event-driven architecture and domain-driven design.

#### **Structure**

1. **Introduction**
   - **Project/System Name**: Name of the project or system.
   - **Date**: Date when the document is created.
   - **Author(s)**: Name(s) of the author(s) or the architecture team.

2. **Domain Events**
   - **Event Identification**: List and describe all significant events that occur within the domain.
   - **Event Attributes**: Document the attributes associated with each event, such as timestamp, source, and any relevant data.

3. **Commands and Triggers**
   - **Commands**: Identify and document the commands that trigger domain events.
   - **Triggers**: Explain the conditions or actions that lead to the occurrence of each event.

4. **Aggregates and Contexts**

### Domain Events Diagram

**Project/System Name**: MonitorMe  
**Date**: April 2024  
**Author(s)**: John Doe, Jane Smith

#### 1. Introduction

This document provides a visual representation of the key domain events within the MonitorMe system, illustrating the flow of events, their triggers, and the relationships between them.

#### 2. Domain Events

- **Patient Check-In**
  - **Attributes**: Timestamp, Patient ID, Check-In Location
  - **Description**: Occurs when a patient arrives and checks in at the hospital.

- **Vital Signs Recorded**
  - **Attributes**: Timestamp, Patient ID, Vital Signs Data
  - **Description**: Captures the patient's vital signs at regular intervals.

- **Anomaly Detected**
  - **Attributes**: Timestamp, Patient ID, Anomaly Details
  - **Description**: Triggered when an abnormal pattern is detected in the patient's vital signs.

- **Alert Sent**
  - **Attributes**: Timestamp, Patient ID, Alert Type, Alert Details
  - **Description**: Notifies medical staff of a detected anomaly.

#### 3. Commands and Triggers

- **Record Vital Signs**
  - **Trigger**: Scheduled intervals or manual initiation by medical staff.
  - **Description**: Command to capture the patient's vital signs.

- **Analyze Data**
  - **Trigger**: Completion of a vital signs recording.
  - **Description**: Command to analyze the recorded data for anomalies.

- **Send Alert**
  - **Trigger**: Detection of an anomaly.
  - **Description**: Command to send an alert to the medical staff.

#### 4. Aggregates and Contexts

- **Patient Monitoring Aggregate**
  - **Events**: Patient Check-In, Vital Signs Recorded
  - **Commands**: Record Vital Signs, Analyze Data

- **Alert Management Aggregate**
  - **Events**: Anomaly Detected, Alert Sent
  - **Commands**: Send Alert

#### 5. Visual Representation

**Legend**:
- **Orange Sticky Notes**: Domain Events
- **Blue Sticky Notes**: Commands
- **Yellow Sticky Notes**: Aggregates

#### 6. Event Flow

**Flow Description**:
- The process begins with the **Patient Check-In** event.
- At scheduled intervals, the **Record Vital Signs** command triggers the **Vital Signs Recorded** event.
- The **Analyze Data** command is then executed, leading to the **Anomaly Detected** event if an anomaly is found.
- Finally, the **Send Alert** command triggers the **Alert Sent** event, notifying medical staff.

**Interactions**:
- The **Vital Signs Recorded** event interacts with the **Analyze Data** command.
- The **Anomaly Detected** event leads to the **Send Alert** command.

#### 7. Review and Validation

- **Review Process**: The domain events diagram will be reviewed in collaboration with domain experts and stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Stakeholders will provide feedback during review sessions to validate the event flows and interactions.

#### 8. Conclusion

The domain events diagram provides a clear visual representation of the key events within the MonitorMe system. It helps in understanding the flow of events and their triggers, facilitating effective design and implementation of the system.

#### 9. Appendices

**Glossary**:
- **Domain Event**: A significant occurrence within the system.
- **Command**: An action that triggers one or more domain events.
